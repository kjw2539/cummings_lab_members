# How to make new water
## your step-by-step guide


### (1) Add Prime.   
The amount depends on what container of Prime you’re using.
Read the instructions and add enough to treat 100 gallons (each reservoir is 50 gallons).  

### (2) Add tap water into the reservoirs until they are full. **Do not walk away from the hose.**   
Use the green house on the black shelving by the sink.

### (3) Turn on the pump for 30 minutes.
Inside the grey box above the pump, press the 30 minute button.   
This will turn the pump on for 30 minutes then shut it off.    
Make sure you hear the pump turn on and verify that water is pumping.   
After 30 minutes the Prime and water are well mixed and you can use the water.

## faq:
q — I'm in the downstairs fish room. What do I do?       
a — The steps for refilling water in the downstairs fish room are the same. The Prime is on the black shelving. The reservoir is 35 gallons instead of 2 x 50 gallons upstairs.  You'll have to refill the reservoir with get tap water from the hose to the right of the sink. It's best if you have two people for this job. Instead of turning on the pump, notice that there are a mass of four cords tied together coming out of the reservoir. These are attached to blowers in the reservoir, which blow around water. Plug in all four cords. Wait _at least_ half an hour before using this water in fish tanks.

q — Why do we use this water instead of water from the sink?      
a — Water we get from the tap has chorine and other stuff that will kill the fish. Adding Prime removes the chlorine, removes any nitrogenous products, and adds some chemicals that help the fish maintain the slime coat on their scales. Adding water straight from the tap into a tank will kill the fish in the that tank.

q — When do I make new water?       
a — Make new water when the water level is at or below the level of the pump in the left reservoir.

q — I can’t find the Prime. Where is it?       
a — The Prime should be in a white bottle under the sink to your right. If there isn’t, there will be some on the shelving next to the microscope computer in 511 (the main lab room). 

q — The pump isn’t turning on. What do I do?      
a — The pump is plugged in to an outlet about you—try reseting the circuit by standing on a stool and hitting the reset button between the two outlets. Try pressing the large button inside the grey timer box. Or just find Luke and ask him.

q — The pump won’t stop running. What do I do?     
a — To turn the pump off at any time, press the large button inside the grey timer box.

q — I have to do water changes but there isn’t enough water. What should I do?      
a — Make water and do them later. Or make water first then do water changes if you have the time.
