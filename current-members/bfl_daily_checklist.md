## Daily Checks

All of the following should be conducted on **both** the East- and West-side tanks:

- [ ] Before entering BFL, make sure you don't have any sunscreen, lotion, or mosquito repellent (no chemicals of any kind) on your hands or legs. These chemicals can enter the water supply and have the potential to make the fish sick.
- [ ] Lock the gate after you enter BFL and no chemicals (sunscreen, lotion, mosquito repellent) on your hands/arms!
- [ ] Check that water is flowing out of all the spigots and that no water is spilling over the lip of the tanks
- [ ] Check for dead fish on the surface
- [ ] (winter only) Check the temperature of the tanks. If the water temperature is very cold, this may mean that the heater is damaged. 
- [ ] Record everything electronically using the Google Form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Zj5Gx3GHfuCDtYmn1).

## Health Checks

In addition to the tasks above, you will occasionally be assigned one or more in-depth health checks on a subset of tanks. When you go to BFL, you'll want to bring some flake food and a critter carriers to bring back snails in:

- [ ] Rid the tank of excessive algae. Always check for babies first! Throw algea someone in the woods or somewhere otherwise _out of sight_. When fancy donors come to tour BFL, we want the fish tanks to look nice.
- [ ] If there's too much good plant coverage (>80%), pull some out (to about 60%).
- [ ] Save the snails. Snails help eat algea off the tanks in the lab. When doing a health check, you should bring a critter carrier to bring the snails back to lab in.
- [ ] Make sure the tank has two labels. One should be a tank number and the other should give the species of the fish in the tank.
- [ ] Check for dead fish at the bottom of the tank (How?)
- [ ] Remove algae off the mesh overflow filters.
- [ ] Check for any concrete/rebar decay.
- [ ] Sprinkle flake food in the tank.
- [ ] Is there a form for filling out here?
