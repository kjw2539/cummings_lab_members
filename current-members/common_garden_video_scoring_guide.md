# guide to scoring common garden videos

## aggression
An aggressive act can be displayed by large, intermediate, and small males, as well as females. These acts can be identified easily by taking a step back and looking at the whole screen--if there is a burst of movement, it is likely aggression. 

Looking more closely, one can conclude that aggression occurred if there is a chase. This is defined as one fish closely following another (usually less than one fish-length behind) at a higher speed than normal swimming. Sometimes these chases will last for less than a second, but other times they may continue for the entire video. A good example of this occurs in the SS1, 6-minute video taken on 8/8/16. To count the number of chases in these cases, look for short pauses and turns. If the chasing fish pauses and then speeds back up again, or if the fleeing fish changes direction and the chasing fish follows, count the chases as separate. Looking for chases especially comes in handy when distinguishing small males from large juveniles. 

Small males have a habit of slowly sneaking up behind females and attacking. Female aggression is more subtle and is usually much shorter- a good example can be found in the FF1, 6-minute video taken on 8/8/16. Many times large male aggression occurs when another large male courts a female or if a small male swims near a female. Examples of these can be found in the 8/8/16, LS1 6-minute, and 1-minute videos. 


## courting
Large, intermediate, and small males can court females and juveniles, though most of the time large or intermediate males will be courting larger females. 

One way males court is by swimming besides the females, usually faster than normal, and then sharply turning to swim in front of them and cut them off. This may be accompanied by other display behaviors such as spreading their fins or waving their gonopodium. An example of a gonopodium wiggle can be found in the LL2, 1-minute video taken on 8/8/16. These may be hard to see unless the fish is up close or swimming in front of a dark background. 

Other ways males court is by swimming in front of the females and then shimmying backwards towards the female, or by facing the female and swimming side-to-side in front of her. Again, these acts may happen once or consecutively, so if there are pauses or if the female swims away and the male continues to pursue her, count them as multiple courts. 


## identifying small males
Small males are sometimes hard to identify, especially if there are large juveniles present. Juveniles however have rounded bellies while small males are thin. In addition, females are drab in color while small males may have a yellow or blue tint. As stated earlier, the best way to spot a small male is by watching the females--most of the time small males lurk around and chase them. 


## tips
When taking videos, makes sure that all the plants and pots are pushed towards the back of the tank and that everything else that may obstruct views (such as floating leaves, tape on the tank, or thermometers) are out of view. Try to get the video to be center and level as well as close as possible without cutting out the tank label.
