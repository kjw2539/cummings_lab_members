# How To Do Water Changes   

Water changes ensure that each tank maintains proper water chemistry and a healthy environment for all the fish. Water changes also clear away any uneaten food and fish droppings, which leach toxic chemicals into the tank.

Follow these instructions when it’s your turn to do water changes:

1.	Locate the rack of tanks whose water you’re changing. The rack numbers are listed on pieces of tape on each of the racks.
2.	Locate the siphon. It’s probably hanging on one of the racks.
3.	Get yourself a bucket. The buckets are to the right of the sink. You’ll use the buckets to hold the water you’ll empty from each of the tanks.
4.	Submerge the siphon into the first tank. The goal is to remove all the air from the siphon. This is most easily done but coiling the siphon into a circle and submerging it completely under water. Cover up the small end of the siphon with your finger, put the small end of the siphon into the bucket, and remove your finger. Water should begin to flow. If not, repeat this step.
5.	Clean the gravel. Press the large end of the siphon into the gravel to suspend food and poop. Try to suck up as much of this crud as possible.
6.	Remove 15% of the water in the tank.
7.	Check the tank label. If there is any indication that any of the fish are sick or being treated for some disease, make sure to submerge for the siphon into the bleach solution to the left of the sink for about 2 minutes and then wash thoroughly with water. The goal is to not infect any of the other tanks.
8.	Repeat steps 4-7 for each tank, pouring the dirty water into the sink in the back of the room as needed.
9.	Fill each tank with fresh water. The water you’ll want to add to each tank is in the big plastic reservoirs towards the back left of the fish room. You’ve got a couple options, but in all cases you want to fill the tanks up such that the top of the water reaches the bottom of the black lining on the top of each tank:
•	Fill by hand. Take a critter cage (the clear, plastic, stackable containers from the rack to the left of the sink), dip the critter cage into one of the reservoirs, and pour out into one of the tanks. Repeat.
•	Fill by pump. Not for the faint of heart. It’s probably best to just ask Luke about it.
10.	Make sure each tank is covered with its plastic cover.
11.	Sign off on the schedule on the back door.
