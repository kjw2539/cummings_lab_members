# Daily Morning Fish Care Checklist

:clock12: Feed fish.
  - All fish get a flake / Cargill pellet blend made in-house by the resident chef.
  - Always err on the side of under-feeding the fish if you’re unsure how much food to put in each tank. The fish should be able to finish all food in under 2 minutes.  

:clock3: Check the health of all the fish.
  - Check for white spots (looks like salt grains) on fish body or fins
  - Check if fish have fins clamped close to body
  - Check if fish have white cotton-like growth on fins or mouth
  - Check if fish have worm-like attachment on body
  - Check for long, white string-like material being excreted by fish (could  be intestinal parasites)
  - **If notice something wrong with a fish, mark tank with tape and email the researcher whose initials are on tank tag.**

:clock5: Make sure the air supply is connected to sponge filter and air is running properly.  Water should not be overly turbulent from the oxygen.
  - If no air coming out, just trace air tube back to source and see if something wrong with valve.

:clock7: Check water levels for all tanks.
  - If water level is low (more than 1 inch of space between tank top and water level), fill with water from reservoir.

:clock9: Make sure all lids are in place. Spare lids are on the black rack to the left of the sink.

:clock6: Put away anything that’s dried to the right of the sink.

:clock930: If you find a dead fish, put fish in Ziploc bag. You can find the Ziploc bags on the hutch outside of the fish room. Write the date, species name, sex, and our initials on the bag. Place the bag in the chest freezer located in the hall between 503 and 502. Make sure to put the deceased in red biohazard bag.  If there is more than one dead fish of the same species from the same tank they can go in the same Ziploc bag. Label the tank with tape and let the researcher know.

:clock11: Record the temperature from the digital thermometer. The air temperature is on top, the water temperature on bottom. Write air temperature / water temperature. Initial on the log.


How do you know which tank belong to what researcher? All the tanks are labeled with initials. Refer to the table below:
