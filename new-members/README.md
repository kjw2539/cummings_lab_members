## Welcome! 

We ask that all new lab members do two things.

(1) [Complete all the online modules in the `tasks_to_complete.md` file above.](https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/blob/master/new-members/tasks_to_complete.md)    
(2) [Read the paper / book chapters in the `readings` folder.] (https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/tree/master/new-members/readings)
